Create a simple server in index.js:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
Update the package.json file to include a start script:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your project root if it doesn't already exist:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p .github/workflows
Create a workflow file (e.g., deploy.yml) in the .github/workflows directory:






Push Your Code
Commit and push your changes to the main branch:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Set up CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will build and deploy your Node.js server.

Additional Notes
Error handling: Ensure proper error handling and logging in your server for better debugging.
Environment variables: Manage sensitive data and environment variables securely.
Testing: Add tests for your Node.js application to ensure stability before deployment.
Scalability: Consider using Docker or Kubernetes for more complex deployment setups.
This is a basic setup to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to customize the pipeline further.
